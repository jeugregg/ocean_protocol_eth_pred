🎯 MARKET OUTLOOK:
Mid-Term Outlook: Neutral
Short-Term Outlook: Bearish
Yesterday, BTC experienced a dip and reached $28,550. However, it quickly rebounded towards $30,040, causing a slight uptick in the rest of the market. But the bears intervened once again, pushing BTC below $29,500, and signaling the potential for a further downward correction.

To confirm a mid-term bullish move, the bulls must break and close above $30,600 on the daily chart.

📈 Up Probability: 45% 📈 - 📉 Down: 55% 📉
🎯 MAIN INTEREST LEVELS 🎯

⬇️ HEAVY SHORT INTERESTS AROUND $30300 LEVEL ⬇️

💼 TRADING ACTION PLAN 💼
Our current positions remain solid and unchanged. Our recent short positions perfectly caught the first target of 28600 local short-term lows, resulting in profitable moves.

It has historically dumped harder than the stock market when stocks have dumped. Betting that$BTCwill go up when stocks, watches (yeah I called that top too.), cars, real estate are going down, seems pretty risky.

The world bought bonds. The bonds are all down massively. They're pretending it doesn't matter, using tactics like, ""Hold till expiration."" At some point the reality  must be realized. As interest rates go up to fight inflation (government money printing), bonds continue to fall in value, and t-bills and chill keeps paying better, sucking money out of stocks, venture capital.

TLDR; Interest rates, higher for longer to fight inflation. People sell bonds and stocks to buy t-bills. Risky to bet on BTC to decouple and act like a safe haven from stocks when historically it's just done what stocks have, but harder. Few things have shown they can pump during dumps :)

I'm not a professional of any type. This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

@TKralow,"Crypto has been on a wild ride lately.

With rumors flying about a possible$BTCETF being approved soon:

• People are buzzing
• The market is getting volatile

The best thing to do right now? Get clarity.

Let's break BTC ETF approval down ↓

🔸 What are Bitcoin ETFs?

Imagine a bucket where instead of buying Bitcoin directly, you buy a piece of this bucket that tracks its price.

This is called an exchange-traded fund, or ETF for short.

You're basically betting on Bitcoin's price without actually holding any Bitcoin yourself.

🔸 So, what's the deal?

When you go for a Bitcoin ETF, you're not directly buying the crypto.

Instead, you're buying a share of this fund through your regular brokerage account.

The fund's job is to manage the money, buying and selling#Bitcoinon your behalf.

Now, getting one of these ETFs up and running isn't a walk in the park.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a big financial watchdog, needs to give the green light.

They take their time, checking everything thoroughly, which makes the approval process quite lengthy and complicated.

🔸 Why should the crypto community care about a Bitcoin ETF?

Well, if the SEC says yes, it's expected to open the floodgates for billions of dollars to pour into the market.

More money means more demand, which can push Bitcoin's price up.

Analysts are keeping their eyes peeled, some even saying that Bitcoin's price could skyrocket to between $100,000 and $200,000.

I guess, time will show! 👀",2024-01-05 19:55:00,https://twitter.com/TKralow/status/1743360027610456470#m,129.0,50.0,0.0,41.0,True

1. BTC is a speculative, volatile asset - akin to a fiat currency with questionable backing - think Argentine peso

2.  Other digital assets are not the same as BTC in form, etc.  And how many “fiat” digital assets does the world need - ie, the world does not need or care about the Argentine peso

3.  Governments may take regulatory steps that are bad for BTC

4. The ecosystem has been populated by lawbreakers and fraudsters.

5.  There are no more SEC impediments to approval - SEC is a disclosure-based and process-based regulator - risks are now known and trading processes are adequate BUT you are warned - risks are super high and processes outside US cannot be policed.""",2024-01-09 17:25:00,https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1744771518842745145#m,340.0,73.0,18.0,75.0,True

@PeterLBrandt,"Just a couple of observations about$BTCBitcoin ETFs. Would love to have those smarter than me weigh in (actually, that would include just about everyone).
Observation 1
We old-time career stock/futures traders have gone by the guide that when the average guy on the street clamors to ""get in,"" then its time to sell them what we own
Observation 2
BTC maximalists have viewed one of the predominant values of BTC is that it was outside the control of government -- that it was not dominated by the same financial playground that has ruined so many things
So, how is it that so many BTCoiners view the SEC and ETFs as the savior of their financial future?

-If the$BTCETF gets rejected/postponed I will buy$ETHon the inevitable dip that comes

@JoshGilbert_,"Today marks a significant milestone in the history of bitcoin and crypto assets, taking decentralised finance mainstream onto Wall Street.$BTCThis provides the on-ramp for institutional capital that#bitcoinhas longed for in recent years, with retail investors broadly already owning this asset. It’s good news for crypto markets and supportive of our belief that bitcoin is an unstoppable technology.

We’ve seen a muted reaction to the acceptance so far, given the false acceptance yesterday and the general expectation that the SEC would issue an approval after a decade-long campaign. Instead, we’re seeing positive price action from Ethereum, the next crypto likely in line for a spot#ETF. ETH is now playing catch-up after underperforming bitcoin in 2023.

Looking ahead, this has the potential to drive bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the years ahead, with the ETF opening the doors to trillions of dollars of capital. 
Last year’s performance is a reminder that#cryptohas a place in a diversified investment portfolio. Whatever time horizon you look at, risk-adjusted returns for bitcoin are dramatically higher than any other asset class and the ETF may be the option investors choose to take on. With many other catalysts ahead for bitcoin in 2024, it looks set to be a strong year for the asset.#BitcoinETFs",2024-01-10 21:55:00,https://twitter.com/JoshGilbert_/status/1745202071136264215#m,4.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,True

I think that this was already priced in and that most ppl don't realize that Billions of inflows doesn't just mean they are buying BTC.

I didn't account for the GBTC situation Cobie brought up, that's sharp.

I rotated into ETH and ETH betas effectively catching the bottom on ETHBTC. 

Was up a chunk this morning leverage trading but got greedy, didn't TP and round tripped about 6 figures. Was up $50k closed the day down $50k.

Not convinced ETH is done yet, but definitely annoyed I didn't take some off the table this AM from my perps positions.

@tehMoonwalkeR,"My thoughts on the Grayscale$btcoutflow and the ETFs in generally:

If you break it all down, it's just short - to midterm whale games. Right now, they have control over the market. They are masters in accumulation 

But even they cannot prevent a$btcsupply squeeze

Halving is around the corner, trillions are coming for$btcand at some point, it will get tight 

It is impossible to say when exactly, especially with the massive grayscale outflow

But if it happens, it will be very quick and violent, and we will see a price explosion on#bitcoinunlike anything we have seen so far

🟢Good news first:

- Assets held in#BitcoinETFs is +$4b

- mainstream advertising of$BTCand crypto is giving our industry a healthy nod of approval in much of retails eyes

- halving almost here, and vertical trajectory has ALWAYS followed

- institutions are finally here

- IDOs are printing, these are incredibly money making opportunities 

- supply shock is coming for Bitcoin which will cause severe vertical trajectory

- when we hit $50,000 retail will FOMO back so hard

🔴Bad news:

- institutions are finally here

- giants will spook retail & will be playing 4D chess 

- euphoria has died out for now

- our major ETF narrative now needs a strong narrative to replace it

- trading now is retarded, it’s chop city rn 🔪

- more IDOs mean that less established platforms (and big ones) will be pushing vaporware projects

- we might be in chopsolidation for another 3 weeks I reckon

A lot more to add here but this is just what comes to mind immediately. The next few weeks will be very important.

@Kylechasse,"‘Why does price action for#Bitcoinkeep going up?’:

We see the highest bitcoin adoption rates in countries with poorly managed national currencies.

Bitcoin continues to outcompete other monetary assets in global markets for money.

Why?

Multiple reasons but some reasons$BTCis preferred instead of alternatives:

• fixed supply schedule
• ability to self-custody
• freely perform international transfers
• liquidity
• acceptance in commerce
• potential for adoption growth
• decentralized

Bitcoin is a tidal wave that has long been chipping away at legitimacy in the eyes of the world.

The spotlight was recently on BTC when ETFs were approved. This was a “stamp of approval” for Bitcoin by the SEC.

Most weary investors liked to think of Bitcoin as ‘magic money’ and deemed it to be BS.

But since Trillion dollar institutions like BlackRock keep punting it, and the SEC gave the green light, the market price of Bitcoin has continued to appreciate to 23% YTD.

What we’re witnessing isn’t just a passing fad, it’s the rapid establishment of Bitcoin as the preferred safe haven asset — with enormous ROI potential.

So often people like to live on the 1 minute chart. “Is it going up or down?”

When in fact, we should be considering the longevity of the asset. Bitcoin has a fresh pair of legs on it, legs that will run it up in multiple six digit figures.

@singhabhinav,"Here's why Bitcoin could return to all-time highs before the 2024 halving!⬇️

The Bitcoin halving happens every 4 years. It cuts the new supply of coins in half. The next one is in April 2024.

History shows that the$BTCprice tends to rise a year before and after each halving. This is because lower supply usually leads to higher demand.

Research shows Bitcoin price rallies 32% on average in the 2 months right before each halving.

Bitcoin's last all-time high was around $69,000 in Nov 2021. 

A 32% rally from today's $52,000 price would put Bitcoin back around its former peak.

So the theory is: Based on historical data, Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high again before the 2024 halving.

Of course, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. 

But the crypto community expects history to repeat itself with the next halving.

If demand rises as supply gets cut, Bitcoin could be on track to break $69,000 again before April 2024. 

An exciting possibility!

Do you think a new ATH is possible before halving?",2024-02-19 18:10:00,https://twitter.com/singhabhinav/status/1759641582385426671#m,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,True

•#BitcoinETFs are eating up all supply.

• Non-Bitcoin ETFs will add portions of$BTCto their holdings to diversify and seek higher returns.

• We're heading into the first real#Bitcoinsupply shock in history thanks to shrinking$BTCon exchanges and ETFs continuing to grow while retail accelerates.

• Ethereum ETFs pending. If this goes, it will be the strongest signal for a record-breaking#altseasonever and trigger speculation over what other crypto assets will enter into an ETF.

• The Bitcoin halving is ~60 days from now, delivering less inflation than gold.

• The FED will likely be easing which is always a bullish scenario for risk-on assets.

• Building on Bitcoin and DeFi with Layer 2s.$STX,$sBTC, etc. This may potentially have the largest upside of anything as liquidity from BTC is unlocked.

• Bitcoin#Ordinals, BRC20’s, etc. maturing working alongside Layer 2's for more utility.

• US debt is insane, growing, and never-ending. Enough said there. It's depressing.

In my 50 years of trading their has never been anything like Bitcoin (and its cheap knock-off pretenders).
Statistically,$BTC's has been a 3 σ experience. You might be very wrong if you are relying on a lifetime of 3σ markets as a trader. IMO, it is really important for you to learn how to trade normal markets if you plan to make a living from markets. I hope this appraisal is wrong for your sake, but advances in BTC have been obscene. Markets do not allow obscenities forever. You may claim that ""this time it's different,"" and that your  life of trading will be one 3σ after another. Don't bet on it.

Minha percepção é que para um rally que leve aos patamares de topo de ciclo o BTC precisa do empurrão monetário.

Por tal motivo não estava crente nesse último rally que foi mais baseado na ampla adoção via ETFs e em menor medida no Halving.

Se tivesse de arriscar uma trajetória seria a de queda nos próximos meses à medida que economia global deteriora tbm. 

Em algum momento os BCs globais atuarão (assumindo o cenário acima) e a partir daí será o momento que estarei bastante animado e voltarei a aumentar posição no ativo.

Aproveitei os últimos meses para reduzir parte do que carrego. 

Espero voltar a aumentar em alguns meses.

@tehMoonwalkeR,"Some thoughts:

Governments have been sitting on massive amounts of$BTCfor a while. 

Now we have ETFs, and they dump ultra aggressively? Coincidence? Unlikely. 

Someone asked for a dip.

Gary and Powell have been the biggest western wealth destroyers we've seen in decades. 

Quite impressive. 

Since we know both are not controlled by the president, the question is who is doing this and why?

This is far bigger than$crypto. 

This is the biggest wealth shift we have ever seen. 

The middle class has been completely destroyed through multi-year warfare—first COVID (basically locking all businesses up), then Ukraine, and now inflated energy prices and expensive loans.

The only people benefiting from this are those who can wait for 3-5 years AND buy the dips. 

So the ultra-wealthy will get richer, while retail gets rekt harder.

There is only one ticket out of this mess, and it is$crypto. 

Yet still, so many retailers are oblivious to$BTCand$crypto.

There will be more selling by claimants as literally every single of them is in sigficant profit and may want to secure some. But we are also seeing huge buys from ETF investors. So hoping that will hold up.

On macro side the inflation is looking good for soft July print and Powell will probably signal the rate cut for September in the next meeting. That could start another rally in stocks, this time in slow caps and not big tech. 

The recent rumours are indicating that Kamala Harris is looking to endorse crypto soon. I take that as another positive news as crypto regulation will be more friendly no matter who wins.

But hindsight is always 20/20$btcadjusted to inflation didn't really hit a new ATH

& without the ETF inflows alts would've never seen the capital inflows they did

i think we are all just early 

i'm in the camp of us having a normal bull cycle starting Q4 and running until end of Q1""25 to early Q2""25 before we see our first big correction, then i think well probably get our true blow off top in Q4""25

CT sentiment rn is at an all time low

some of the most followed accounts haven't tweeted in weeks

I think we see our true bottom in september with rate cuts (i hope i'm wrong and we already bottomed)

but I really think the bullish sentiment will come back in full swing in Q4

-presidential election
-cheaper money (rate cuts)
-QE
-bitcoin supply shock

hope is right around the corner

and lock in for the real bull that's yet to come

these are just my own opinions btw. I could be completely wrong. I've only been active in crypto since March of 2020 and i admit i've been wrong a lot. But i admit my mistakes and i do my best to learn from them while documenting my lessons.

@QuintenFrancois,"$BTChas always been a binary thing: either going to $0 or $1,000,000.

In 2016-‘18 the chances of it going to zero were still 50% imo.

Now the chances of this happening are less than 5% imo. Meaning#bitcoinstill has an 11x potential to $1,000.000 for a risk of less than 5%.

Didn't want to miss $100k and then flushed everyone to $30k etc. 

Feels similar again where everyone front ran the Presidential campaign and perhaps didn't consider these things take time - and who knows if it even gets passed/approved.

Most FOMO in because $100k etc. and if they add it - too late miss the entry etc. and then it fades then get a bit too much too soon, add a few times and we could be in for a really big flush out (which would be healthy). 

Anytime retail gets super crowded sometimes it happens right away but other times it just prolongs the inevitable because  too many expecting same thing and already prepared for it. 

When we get huge moves it's because people are caught off guard, not because they were well prepared. 

In order to capture that we need to flush the heck out of retail. 

Reminds me of last time people were looking at$MSTRaverage buy price at $19k or so suggesting he was going to get margin called - that ended up being an unreal buy point.

So $62,473.01 average entry now so if it does stay heavy and people start suggesting they will have a big issue perhaps that will be the time to buy again lol.

But for now, likely have to work through huge supply from everyone who is second guessing all the$BTCthey bought for Trump ++ etc. Once those buyers turn into sellers and the inventory is back in strong hands if/when we test $100k again I think it'd be a very fast $110-130K. But for now, I can't see it going too crazy anytime soon.

Overall very bullish for crypto 

President Trump pretty much gave the green light on$ADA,$BTC,$ETH,$XRP&$SOLto Wall Street, Retail & Institutional Investors 

That being said I don’t understand the ins & outs of how the US will be acquiring these projects for a reserve 

Will the government market buy these projects, does it need to be gifted to the government to work around our current legislation 

These are all things we will find out in the coming weeks 

The good news is that we wiped out a months worth of negative trading in one candle$BTCclosed above 90k 

& Sentiment has shifted in the crypto space

Again these are for short term trading opportunities.

Not to be confused w/ a long term opinion or thesis.

Permabulls have a hard time understanding this and always are first to chime in on a bounce after the thesis and range is hit. 

Last time tweeted thoughts it fades $20-$25k and then it bounces back a little bit and the permabulls ""BTC shorts are mistaken. Almost time to punish them. Keep piling in."" etc. ... 

No one is suggesting piling into weakness and when the target range has been hit -- That wouldn't suggest entry that would suggest exit.

Trump için oldukça makul ve sözünü yerine getiren bir adım oldu. Zaten her yıl 200k alımla, toplam 1 milyon adet BTC'nin stratejik rezerve 5 senede eklenmesi hedefleniyordu. İlk seneyi böylece cebe koydular.

Diğer yandan rezervin büyütülmesi için ""bütçe nötr"" bir yaklaşım güdülecek. Bu ne demek? Vergi harcamayalım demek. Peki, bundan ne anlamalıyız?

Farklı yorumlar yapılabilir ama aklıma ilk gelen; suç amaçlı kullanılan kripto varlıklar ele geçirildikçe stratejik rezerve eklenecektir. Bu durum kripto varlıkların geleneksel yapılara entegrasyon sürecini de hızlandıracak. Diğer bir söylem ile müesses nizam (kurulu düzen) bunu sevecektir.

@novogratz,"Crypto musings…

1. The announcements yesterday were huge.  Historical. That we have a$BTCreserve will send a message to every country.   This is a very big deal. 

2.  Allowing Banks to participate will greatly increase institutional adoption.  
This might be more important than the reserve.  

3. Hearing the Sec Treas talk about the importance of$USDstablecoins in keeping the dollar the world’s reserve currency tells me that we have a team that gets it.  Very Bullish stables. 

4 why has price of crypto been heavy in 2025.   To start we had a frenzy in Q4 that peaked into inauguration with a Crypto Ball.   Lots got priced in.  All these changes being made take time to implement and institutions move methodically.  Chinese crypto players have a white hot stock market to invest in.$BABAis outperforming any crypto by a lot this year.   We haven’t gotten a new ‘killer app’ on Web3 that’s taken hold to drive narrative on L1’s like$ETHand$sol. 
Meme coin frenzy crashed with$Trumpcoin. US stocks which were priced for perfection being sold as people rotate out of America  exceptionalism into China and Europe.   

5.  What’s next .$BTCneeds to retake 91k to regain momentum buyers.  Until then we are 75-90 range on charts.  
Rest of Crypto needs a retail Calvary.   What i do know is every time you think they are gone they come back.   Need to see that to get market turned around.$ETHshould hold 2k and needs to hold 2k.    

Medium and long  term this is very bullish. Shorter term a lot of counter balancing forces.

@martypartymusic,"Why#Zeuswill change the#Bitcoinlandscape and make Bitcoin LIQUID in the crypto closed loop.

Zeus is infra. Thats ""infrastructure"". It is a software layer enabling$BTCto be confirmed on the Bitcoin Network via Solana. 

Summary: Zeus sits between older technology networks typically proof of work mined networks and modern high speed networks to enable these older network assets to instantly become fast and able to participate in the new economy of defi. 

With$ZEUSgoing live new founders can now build Dapps and new disruptive ideas with#Bitcoin. Lightning Network did not deliver. Bitcoin is dormant despite what you have been told. I hold Bitcoin and the only way to use it or appreciate it is when more of it is bought or held. There is no way to make passive income (yield) because the network has no programmatic capabilities. This changes today. This is the first and only layer that can transform how Bitcoin is moved through the closed loop of crypto allowing Bitcoin holders to earn, borrow and participate. 

Zeus$zBTCwill eat away at the wrapped counterfeit versions like$cbBTCand$WBTCwhich are not Bitcoin, they are permissioned securities with counterparty risk. You cannot participate. The issuers of wrapped Bitcoin hold the keys and earn the yield. Now you can.

Young founders. Download the ZPL libraries and start inventing new Bitcoin Dapps. Go to market first. This is a huge opportunity.

Users that hold Bitcoin and want to use it to pay and earn yield. Mint some$zBTCsend it to your@phantomand start using it. 

Speed: Mint some$zBTCwith your$BTC, now go send $10 of it to someone on@phantomit takes 1s to settle on#Solanaand will appear in their wallet almost instantly. You just sent native Bitcoin in 1s permissionlessly. Its that simple. 

Yield: Take your$zBTCand add liquidity to the$zBTC/$USDC pools on#SolanaDEX's, you are now earning yield on every$USDCStable Coin transaction on#Solanawith your$BTC. 

Founders, get busy. You can now build apps we have only dreamed of. The door is open with$ZEUSand the ZPL libraries. Build. Build. Build.

Now understand they have just started. Next will be other proof of work assets like$LTCand$DOGEwhich will then also benefit from the high speed networks.

@Benzinga,"How traders can profit from Bitcoin's sideways action, according to@10xResearch🟠💹

Bitcoin$BTCis stuck in a tight range — and 10x Research says it’s time to ditch momentum trading and go pro.

🔍 Key takeaways: 
• Most of BTC’s 2024 gains (+113%) came in just two months
• April–Sept is historically a choppy season for crypto
• Retail traders are backing off, while institutions dominate
• No big upside catalysts short-term — $73K seen as a floor

💡 Pro tip from 10x:
→ In this low-volatility market, structured strategies like selling options (puts/calls around the 80–120% strike) can generate income with lower risk
→ Watch implied volatility:
<40% → buying options favored
60% → selling options favored

📉 With fewer breakout moves, it's all about precision and timing — not just HODLing.",2025-04-22 18:45:00,https://twitter.com/Benzinga/status/1914751306301948013#m,7.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,True

But personally, I believe we’re in the calm before the next storm.
The kind of storm where your grandmother starts asking about altcoins.
Where every newspaper headline screams ""Bitcoin hits new record!""
Where people who laughed at you suddenly want “just a little advice.”

To those still here  those who’ve stuck it out through the quiet, the dips, the doubt stay consistent.
This is the part where most get bored and walk away.

@TheCryptoLark,"A massive$ETHbreakout is on the horizon.

Ethereum’s on-chain metrics and market performance are all pointing to a potential bull run in the near-term. 

Here’s what I'm seeing:

1.$ETHoutperforming$BTCin Q2 so far

2. Protocol Enhancements
The recent Pectra upgrade has improved scalability and lowered ETH’s inflation rate.

3. Spiking Institutional Interest
Exchange balances are at seven-year lows, and ETH ETFs are seeing significant inflows. 

This all suggests longer-term accumulation by bigger players. 

So the points above look pretty bullish.

@alrawenet,"📊 تحليل On-Chain للبيتكوين$BTC– 20 يونيو 2025:

– مؤشر NUPL عند 0.5 ➜ السوق يحقق أرباحًا قوية لكن لم نصل لفقاعة.
– احتياطي المنصات يواصل الهبوط التاريخي ➜ نية واضحة للتجميع لا البيع.
– MVRV عند 2.2 ➜ بداية مناطق الحذر من قمم الدورة.
– مؤشر SOPR فوق 1 ➜ البائعون يحققون أرباحًا، لا يوجد ذعر.
🔍 لا مؤشرات فقاعة حاليًا، لكن الحذر الذكي مطلوب.
💡معلومة :
الفقاعة (Bubble) تعني أن السعر يرتفع بشكل غير منطقي وبسرعة، إلى مستويات تفوق القيمة الحقيقية، بسبب الطمع والمضاربة، وليس بسبب نمو فعلي في الاستخدام أو التبني.
🔹 ماذا يحدث داخل الفقاعة؟
1-يدخل المستثمرون بسبب ""الخوف من فوات الفرصة"" (FOMO).

2-ترتفع الأسعار بشكل مبالغ فيه دون دعم من البيانات الواقعية.

3-يبدأ الكبار (الحيتان – المؤسسات) بالبيع فجأة.

4-تنفجر الفقاعة: ينهار السعر بسرعة ويخسر الكثيرون.

Wed: 
*Trump visits UK; Nvidia’s Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Blackstone CEO and BlackRock’s Larry Fink will also be joining Trump
*BOC meeting, cut expected
*FOMC meeting (25bps cut expected, cut for the first time in 9months, a 50bps cut would signal that Fed is worried about the economy), we will also get updated dot plot & Economic Projections; market focus will focus on any dissent & what powell says about future rate cuts. 
BE: We expect the FOMC to cut rates by 25 basis points. That won’t be because economic data on both sides of Fed’s mandate – price stability and full employment – warrant it. Rather, the markets expect a rate cut, the White House wants it — and we think Powell is doing what he sees as needed to fend off further threats to the Fed’s independence.

@martypartymusic,"The UK Metropolitan Police (Met Police) executed what they describe as the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure, involving approximately 61,000#Bitcoincurrently valued at over £5.5 billion (roughly $7.3 billion USD at today's$BTCprice of ~$119,500). 

This stems from a seven-year investigation into international money laundering tied to a massive fraud scheme in China. 

The seizure is a landmark in crypto enforcement, surpassing previous records like the U.S. DOJ's 2022 seizure of ~$3.6 billion in BTC from the Silk Road dark web marketplace (now worth more but seized at a lower value). 

The Met's action highlights growing global scrutiny on crypto's role in illicit finance, with blockchain analytics enabling such traces. Key Details of the Case 
The Offender: Zhimin Qian (also known as Yadi Zhang), a 47-year-old Chinese national of no fixed address, pleaded guilty on September 29, 2025, at Southwark Crown Court to two counts under the Proceeds of Crime Act (2002): acquiring criminal property (cryptocurrency) and possessing criminal property (cryptocurrency).

The Fraud Scheme: Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a large-scale investment scam in China, defrauding over 128,000 victims and amassing billions in illicit funds. She converted the proceeds into Bitcoin for easier cross-border movement.",2025-09-29 23:00:00,https://twitter.com/martypartymusic/status/1972798131570937865#m,104.0,13.0,6.0,29.0,True

Last cycle, gold was worth ~$10T so people targeted $500k$BTCto flip gold or around $250k to be worth half of gold.

Gold is now worth $25T+ so the relative valuation targets are much higher.$BTCnow needs to reach around $1.2M to flip gold, or $600k to be worth half.

Even if bitcoin doesn't reach those levels anytime soon, having them as targets relative to gold makes current prices seem much more reasonable than they would have last cycle when even $100k was seen as a crazy long term target by some people.
